This dataset from the UCI repository consists of 8,800 time series, derived from recordings of spoken Arabic digits. It includes 10 digits, each repeated 10 times by 88 native Arabic speakers (44 males and 44 females) aged between 18 and 40. Each instance in the dataset is represented by 13 Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), which are computed for each analysis frame. The MFCCs were extracted under the following conditions: a sampling rate of 11,025 Hz, 16-bit resolution, a Hamming window applied, and a pre-emphasis filter of 1-0.97Z^(-1). The task is to classify the spoken digit based on the MFCC features provided.
