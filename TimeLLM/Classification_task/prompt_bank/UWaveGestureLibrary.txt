The dataset consists of 4,480 gesture samples from eight participants, collected using a Wii remote with a three-axis accelerometer over multiple weeks. Each participant performed eight different predefined gestures ten times per session across seven days. This extensive dataset captures variations in gesture performance over time and between users, making it ideal for testing gesture recognition algorithms under realistic conditions.
