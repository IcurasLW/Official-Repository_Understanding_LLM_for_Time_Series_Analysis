The EthanolConcentration dataset contains raw spectra of water-and-ethanol solutions from 44 different whisky bottles, with ethanol concentrations of 35%, 38%, 40%, and 45%. The goal is to classify the alcohol concentration in a given bottle using spectroscopy data. Each sample consists of three repeated readings of the same bottle and solution batch, using a StellarNet BLACKComet-SR spectrometer over a wavelength range of 226nm to 1101.5nm. The dataset is designed to simulate real-world conditions for detecting forged alcohol, with minimal attempts to standardize readings beyond avoiding labels and seams on the bottles.
