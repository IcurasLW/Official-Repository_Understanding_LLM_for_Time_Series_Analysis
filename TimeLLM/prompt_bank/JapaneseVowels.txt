This UCI Archive dataset contains recordings of 9 Japanese male speakers saying the vowels 'a' and 'e'. A 12-degree linear prediction analysis was applied to the recordings to produce 12-dimensional time series with an original length between 7 and 29. Each instance in the dataset has been padded to a uniform length of 29. The classification task is to identify the speaker based on these transformed utterances. Each instance has 12 x 29 values and a class label [1...9] corresponding to the speaker. The training set includes 30 utterances per speaker, while the test set varies from 24 to 88 instances per speaker, depending on external factors.
