This dataset, from a 2014 Kaggle competition, contains MEG recordings used to determine whether a subject was shown a picture of a face or a scrambled image, independent of the subject. The training data includes 10 subjects (subject01 to subject10) with approximately 580-590 trials each, and the test data includes 6 subjects (subject11 to subject16). Each trial captures 1.5 seconds of MEG data, starting 0.5 seconds before the stimulus, with a label indicating Face (class 1) or Scramble (class 0). The data was down-sampled to 250Hz, high-pass filtered at 1Hz, and contains 62 observations per channel across 306 channels. A leave-one-patient-out approach is recommended for analysis.
