This dataset from the California Department of Transportation includes 15 months of freeway data from the San Francisco Bay Area, recording the occupancy rate of car lanes every 10 minutes from January 1, 2008, to March 30, 2009. Each day is a time series with 963 dimensions (sensors) and 144 intervals, excluding public holidays and two anomalous days, resulting in 440 time series. The goal is to classify each day by the correct day of the week based on the recorded data.
