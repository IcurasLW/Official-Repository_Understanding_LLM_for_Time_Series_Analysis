This dataset, derived from the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2016, contains heart sound recordings from various global contributors, collected in both clinical and nonclinical settings from healthy individuals and patients with cardiac conditions. The recordings were taken from up to nine different body locations, typically the aortic, pulmonic, tricuspid, and mitral areas. The dataset is divided into two classes: normal (113 recordings from healthy subjects) and abnormal (296 recordings from patients with cardiac diagnoses, such as heart valve defects or coronary artery disease). Each recording is truncated to 5 seconds and transformed into a spectrogram with a window size of 0.061 seconds and a 70% overlap. The multivariate dataset represents each instance as a frequency band from the spectrogram.
