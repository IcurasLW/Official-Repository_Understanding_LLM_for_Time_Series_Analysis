Dataset from the BCI II competition involves self-regulation of slow cortical potentials, recorded from an artificially respirated ALS patient. The task required the subject to move a cursor up or down on a screen by modulating their slow cortical potentials, with feedback provided both visually and auditorily. Each trial lasted 8 seconds, but only the 4.5-second feedback interval (from 2.0s to 6.5s) was used for training and testing. EEG data was recorded at a 256 Hz sampling rate from 7 channels, resulting in 1152 samples per trial. The training set consists of 200 trials (100 per class), while the test set contains 180 trials. The effectiveness of this data for classification is uncertain, as the best model achieved an error rate of 45.5%.
