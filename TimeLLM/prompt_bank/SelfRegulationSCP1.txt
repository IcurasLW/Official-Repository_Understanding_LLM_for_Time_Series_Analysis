Dataset Ia from the University of Tuebingen involves self-regulation of slow cortical potentials recorded from a healthy subject. The task required the subject to move a cursor up or down on a screen by modulating their slow cortical potentials, with visual feedback provided. Cortical positivity moved the cursor down, while cortical negativity moved it up. Each trial lasted 6 seconds, but only a 3.5-second interval (from 2.0s to 5.5s) was used for training and testing. The EEG data, sampled at 256 Hz, provided 896 samples per channel per trial from six channels. The training set consists of 268 trials (168 from day 1 and 100 from day 2), with six-dimensional data representing the EEG channels. The classification task is to determine whether each trial represents cortical negativity or positivity. The test set contains 293 trials, and the best result achieved an 11.3% error rate.
